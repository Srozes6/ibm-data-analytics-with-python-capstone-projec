# Stack Overflow Developer Survey: Data Wrangling, EDA & Data Visualization (Python)

An end-to-end analytics portfolio project using Python and Jupyter notebooks to **clean, prepare, explore, and visualize survey data**.  
This repository demonstrates a complete workflow commonly used in business and data analytics roles—from raw data issues to clear visual insights.

---

## Project Overview

This project uses the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset to showcase:
- Data wrangling and validation
- Handling duplicates and missing data
- Feature normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Professional data visualization techniques

The notebooks are organized into **lab-style modules** that build on each other.

## Module 2 — Data Wrangling

Focus: preparing raw data for analysis

- **Finding Duplicates**  
  Identify duplicate rows and understand their impact

- **Removing Duplicates**  
  Clean the dataset and verify results

- **Finding Missing Values**  
  Detect and quantify missing data across columns

- **Impute Missing Values**  
  Replace missing values using appropriate strategies (e.g., most frequent value)

- **Normalizing Data**  
  Scale numeric variables to prepare data for modeling and comparison

- **Data Wrangling Lab**  
  End-to-end workflow combining all wrangling steps

## Module 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Focus: understanding patterns and structure in the data

- **Finding How the Data Is Distributed**  
  Analyze distributions, skewness, and spread

- **Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook**  
  Summary statistics, distribution analysis, and initial insights

- **EDA Notes (TXT)**  
  Supporting explanations and interpretations

## Module 4 — Data Visualization

Focus: communicating insights clearly and effectively

- **Bar Charts**  
  Compare categorical values and frequencies

- **Line Charts**  
  Analyze trends over time or ordered variables

- **Stacked Charts**  
  Compare distributions across groups

- **Pie Charts**  
  Visualize proportions and category shares

- **Scatter Plots**  
  Explore relationships between numeric variables

- **Bubble Plots**  
  Visualize relationships using size as a third variable

- **Box Plots**  
  Compare distributions and identify outliers

- **Histograms**  
  Examine data distributions and frequency patterns

All visualizations are created using Python libraries and follow data storytelling best practices.

## Dataset

The notebooks load survey data from Skills Network / IBM-hosted CSV files:
- `survey-data.csv`
- `survey-data-with-duplicate.csv`

(Links are referenced directly inside the notebooks.)
